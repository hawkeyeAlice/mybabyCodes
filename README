Welcome to the babycode series!

I will be writing codes that will make learning easy. Today, I focused on the learning of Japanese characters of Hiragana & Katakana. This code will help you learn Hiragana & Katakana simultaneously. It is helpful for beginners like myself to navigate through the characters and learn the two scripts altogether at one time. I hope it will help you too.

Have a great day!
