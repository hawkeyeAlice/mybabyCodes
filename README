Welcome to the babycode series!

I will be writing codes that will make learning easy.

1) Today, I focused on the learning of Japanese characters of Hiragana & Katakana. This code will help you learn Hiragana & Katakana simultaneously. It is helpful for beginners like myself to navigate through the characters and learn the two scripts altogether at one time. I hope it will help you too.

2) Today, I focused on creating a code for self teaching Python basics in an interactive fashion. You can learn simple things like how to use print statement, conditional statements, for loop and while loop in python. It is really helpful for beginners to play around in the terminal. 

Have a great day!
